Image Graver is an open source tool to convert images to 3d reliefs and create g-code routing information to be used with cnc routers.

The program only relies on javascript for dataprocessing and thus runs fully in your browser without the need of any additional installations. All code is provided with this project.

Tool supports conversion of color images to heightfields, 2d/3d heightfield inspection, basic image operations on the heightfield and gcode export for cnc routers.
